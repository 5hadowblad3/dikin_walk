Dikin walk
----------

Implementation of Dikin walk in Python, an algorithm for drawing a nearly
uniform sample from a polytope. This is my initial stab at understanding and
implementing this algorithm. It has not been thoroughly tested and most likely
has bugs.

See "R. Kannan and H. Narayanan, Random Walks on Polytopes and an Affine
Interior Point Method for Linear Programming."
